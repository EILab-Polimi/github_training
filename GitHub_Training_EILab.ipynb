    "**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to handle projects with speed and efficiency, organizing them in repositories. It allows multiple developers to work together on the same codebase, enabling them to track changes, revert to previous states, and branch off to develop new features without affecting the main project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. It is the leading platform for version control and collaborative software development, allowing developers to store and manage their code. GitHub makes it incredibly easy to collaborate on projects, review code, manage changes, and maintain a history of your work. \\\n",
    "GitHub is the world's largest source code host. It was founded in 2008 and in 2018 was acquired by Microsoft for 7.5 billion US$. AS of January 2023, Github reported having over 100 milion developers and more than 372 milion repositories. "

This flexibility allows us to decide which changes are put together in the current package and which ones to include in the next.\n",

Creating a commit is like taking a snapshot of the entire project at a specific moment, keeping also track of the changes with the previous version. It's what makes version control possible. Each commit comes with a short message explaining what was done. It's best to keep these messages clear and concise (usually less than 60 characters). It's a good practice to keep commits as small as possible, having a single conceptual change in each of them, reflected by the fact that the message summarising all changes inside it shouldn't exceed 60 characters.\n",
